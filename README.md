# AHK++
Compiler created for CMPE 152 at SJSU (WIP)

A really random language based off of C++, Pascal, and AutoHotKey (hence the name AHK++)

(However, we currently lost what we used from AHK, so it's kinda just pascal++)

Current progress:
Assignment 7 - compile Jasmin code and run the code
  -As of 4/27 03:00, all parts of the .g4 file work except for print
